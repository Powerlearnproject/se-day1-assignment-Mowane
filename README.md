# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing,building,testing and maintaining software
Softwareengineerng ensures security by focusing on considerations including authentication,authorisation and focusing on a wide range of activities to secure privacy in the prevalence of cyber threats
It fuels innovation and create new solutions to through analysis of problems and creating groundbreaking appsand aasociate apps to solve daily life problems.
Software engineering has enabled unpredecented innovation from heathcare, finance by bringing in neccessary tools in such areas.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early programming languages including Fortran and COBOL was a significant step towards more accessible programming.
Object Oriented Programming allowed for modular, reusable code by modelling real world entities as object impacting software design and maintainability.
Agile methodologies including scrum and Kanban emphasized iterative development, flexibility and collaboration providing a more responsive approach to software development compared to traditional waterfall models.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
